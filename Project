Purpose:

As Taiwan has already stepped into an aging society, we need to pay more attention to the welfare of elders in various aspects. 
Meanwhile, researches have shown that the rapid development of technology has increased the burden for elders in learning to manipulate high-tech products. 
Therefore, we aimed to design an easy-to-use application to shorten the gap between elders and innovative technologies.
