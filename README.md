# Undergraduate Project - An Auto-website Generator Designed For Elders

* I studied Management Information Systems as my major for undergraduate, and receive a BBA Bachelor's title from National Chiayi University of Taiwan in 2013.

* This repository presents a state-of-the-art auto-website generator which I designed with three other classmates from my undergraduate major in 2012, and it received high recognition from our department professors.

* As the original code has already lost by time, therefore, I can only explain the structure of it through the documentations.

 * For further information, please refers to "Project.md: https://github.com/Johnny9527/UndergraduateProject_2012/blob/master/Project.md".
