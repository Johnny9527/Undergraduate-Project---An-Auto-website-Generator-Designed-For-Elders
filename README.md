# Undergraduate Project - An Auto-website Generator Designed For Elders

1. I studied Management Information Systems as my major for undergraduate, and receive a BBA Bachelor's title from National Chiayi University of Taiwan in 2013.

2. This repository presents a work-of-the-art auto-website generator which I designed with three other classmates from my undergraduate major in 2012, and it received high recognition by department professors.

3. As the original code has already lost by time, therefore, I can only explain the structure of it through the documentations.
