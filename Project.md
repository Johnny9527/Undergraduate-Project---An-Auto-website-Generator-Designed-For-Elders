### Purpose:

As Taiwan has already stepped into an aging society, we need to pay more attention to the welfare of elders in various aspects. 
Meanwhile, researches have shown that the rapid development of technology has increased the burden for elders in learning to manipulate high-tech products. 
Therefore, we aimed to design an easy-to-use application to shorten the gap between elders and innovative technologies.


### Development Tools:

We use ASP.NET as the main development programming language

, Visual Studio as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

, and SQL Server as Database.

### System Structure:

In the system structure, we divided users into two different types, one is called "regular users", which include most of the people, 
and the other is called "super admin user", which behalf as the IT manager of the regular users. 

Each of them retains different privileges in manipulating functions, such as the "super admin user" has the right to check and modify all users' accounts, 
while the "regular users" can customize their personal webpage by adding or deleting applet functions.

### Application Demonstration:

It is easy to use from the aspect of "regular users", only three steps required to complete the whole process.

1. Create a personal account when they use this application for the first time.

2. After creating the account, they can select one of their favorite theme templates.

3. Choose their favorite functions. (Functions are able to be added or removed afterward.)

4. Done!

On the other hand, from the aspect of "super admin user", it is more similar to backstage management. 
Most of their privileges are focus on managing users' data and systems' structure.

Such as changing the content of applets,

or modify the theme templates.

Although this was only a course project from undergraduate, we tried our best to include further features such as customized dragging function,

message board function, which can chat or share ideas with others,

and activities query function, which can check for the upcoming activities.

I have learned lots of things during this undergraduate project, not only in fulfilling the textbook's knowledge into real software development 
but also improve my collaborating skill through teamwork.

### Acknowledgment:
I really appreciated my three other team members who co-work with me during that time 
and the professors who gave our project a high recognition at the final demonstration.
