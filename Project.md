### Purpose:

As Taiwan has already stepped into an aging society, we need to pay more attention to the welfare of elders in various aspects. 
Meanwhile, researches have shown that the rapid development of technology has increased the burden for elders in learning to manipulate high-tech products. 
Therefore, we aimed to design an easy-to-use application to shorten the gap between elders and innovative technologies.


### Development Tools:

We use ASP.NET as the main development programming language

, Visual Studio as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

, and SQL Server as Database.

### System Structure:

In the system structure, we divided users into two different types, one is called "regular users", which include most of the people, 
and the other is called "super admin user", which behalf as the IT manager of the regular users. 

Each of them retains different privileges in manipulating functions, such as the "super admin user" has the right to check and modify all users' accounts, 
while the "regular users" can customize their personal webpage by adding or deleting applet functions.

### Application Demonstration:

It's easy to use from the aspect of "regular users", only three steps required to complete the whole process.

1. Create a personal account when they use this application for the first time.
